To-Do
1) Benchmark Model - AR(1) *DONE*


2) PACF and ACF to find AR(p), MA(q), ARMA(p,q) *DONE*
   Get AIC/BIC/MSE for comparison of model *DONE*

3) Distributed lag *DONE*
 - Adding in indicators
 - AIC/BIC/MSE

4) Forecasting combinations
Bates Granger combination
 - Comparing AIC
 - Point forecast
 - Pseudo out of sample RMSE

5) Compare every single model's MSE on psuedo out of sample
6) Write hypothesis to the results

7) MACHINE LEARNING - ENSEMBLE METHODS
8) DEEP LEARING - RNN, LSTM?
